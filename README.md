Project: EduManager

EduManager is a C++ application designed to manage educational personnel records, including teachers and students. The system provides a secure admin login interface, allowing the administrator to perform various operations such as creating, modifying, displaying, and deleting records. The user interface is enhanced with ANSI escape codes for a colored and user-friendly console output.

 Key Functionalities:
- Admin Login: Secure login mechanism for the admin.
- Record Creation: Add new teacher and student records by inputting details such as name, CNIC, contact number, age, course, employee ID, and salary for teachers; and name, CNIC, contact number, age, CGPA, and degree for students.
- Modify Records: Update existing records for both teachers and students, ensuring that any changes to their details are promptly reflected.
- Display Records: View all teacher and student records, providing a comprehensive overview of the personnel managed by the system.
- Delete Records: Remove specific teacher or student records from the system.
- File Handling: Save and load records to and from text files, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

EduManager uses object-oriented programming principles and file handling to maintain and manage records efficiently, making it a valuable tool for educational administration.
